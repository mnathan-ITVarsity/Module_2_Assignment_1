                            <h3>LOST FOREST</h3>
    <p>The forest is thought to have originated as part of a much larger pine forest that shrank in size during the last glacial period of the Pleistocene era. It was first described by early Spanish explorer Domingo Terán de los Ríos in his expedition along the Colorado River in 1691 and later by Stephen F. Austin and other settlers drawn to the area by the land grants awarded by the Mexican government. The Bastrop Steam Mill Company began lumbering in the Lost Pines in 1838, followed by Higgins Mill in 1840. By 1870 the population for Bastrop County reached 11,000 people, which increased demands for timber. Extensive logging of the Lost Pines occurred around 1880, but the forested land area remained largely intact. The Lost Pines Forest occupied 36,400 hectares in 1880 and of this, 34,400 hectares remained in 1952.</p>
